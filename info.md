When Learning Starts Strong but Fades Away

CONTEXT
Many students enroll in online courses or learning programs with strong motivation. The
intent is clear: learn a new skill, complete the course, and improve outcomes. However,
despite good content, a large number of learners drop off midway. Progress slows, sessions
are skipped, and courses remain unfinished. This doesn't always happen because the
content is poor — often, the learning experience fails to support motivation, clarity, and
momentum over time.
THE CHALLENGE
Think about an online learning experience where users start with interest but struggle to
continue consistently. Your task is to explore why learners lose momentum, where the
experience stops supporting them, and how the flow could be redesigned to help learners
stay engaged and move forward. You are not expected to redesign the entire learning
platform. Focus on one specific part of the learning journey where drop-off commonly
happens.
WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTED TO WORK ON
Identify the learner, their goal, and where motivation drops
Analyze what makes the experience hard to continue
Redesign the learning flow to better support progress and commitment
Demonstrate the improved experience using a prototype or MVP
You may use design tools, code, or no-code platforms to present your solution.
WHAT YOUR PRESENTATION SHOULD INCLUDE
The learning scenario you chose
Why learners disengage at that point
Key gaps in the existing experience
How your redesigned flow helps learners stay on track
A prototype or MVP demonstrating your solution
The expected impact on course completion or engagement
IMPORTANT NOTE
This challenge is not about adding more content or gamification blindly. It's about
designing an experience that supports learning over time.

WHY THIS MATTERS
Good learning design doesn't just attract users — it helps them continue, progress, and
complete what they started.
